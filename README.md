### 📝 Brief

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

- Filter by all/active/complete todos ✅
- Clear all completed todos ✅
- Toggle light and dark mode ✅
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size ✅

- Bonus: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list ✅
- Bonus: Build this project as a full-stack application ✅
